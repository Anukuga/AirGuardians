####  AirGuardians Project: Docker Setup and Alternate Start Method  

We would like to provide an update regarding our AirGuardians project and its Docker setup. Below are detailed instructions for running our project, as well as an explanation of a minor limitation we encountered and the alternate approach we implemented to address it.

---

### **Docker Setup**

We have successfully set up the Docker environment for both the frontend and backend. The Docker setup builds without errors, and the containers for the frontend and backend run successfully. However, we encountered an issue where the **sample data** generated by the backend is not being fetched and displayed on the frontend. We have thoroughly debugged the setup, but the data flow issue persists.

Despite this limitation, our Docker setup works as expected, and both the frontend and backend applications are containerized and operational.

To run the Docker setup, use the following command:

```bash
bash start.sh
```

---

### **Alternate Method: Running the Project with One File**

To ensure that the project runs smoothly and demonstrates the required functionality, we created an alternate script to start the **frontend, backend**, and **sample data generator** manually. Below are the steps for running the project using this method.

---

#### **Steps to Run the Project (Alternate Method)**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anukuga/AirGuardians.git
   cd AirGuardians
   ```

2. Run the following batch script (`start.bat`) to start all components (backend, sample data generator, and frontend):
   ```batch
start cmd /k "python app.py"
timeout /T 2 /nobreak

start cmd /k "python get_sample_data.py" // for sample data
timeout /T 2 /nobreak

start cmd /k "cd .. && cd frontend && timeout /T 1 /nobreak && npm start"
timeout /T 1 /nobreak
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
   - **Backend**: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

### **Explanation of the Batch Script**

- **Backend**: The script starts the Flask backend (`app.py`) that serves the API endpoints.
- **Sample Data**: A separate process runs `sample_data.py`, which generates simulated sample data in real time.
- **Frontend**: The script navigates to the frontend directory and starts the React application using `npm start`.

---

### **Current Limitations**

1. **Docker Integration Issue**: While the backend and frontend run successfully in Docker, the sample data generated by the backend does not display correctly in the frontend due to data flow issues between containers.  
2. **Alternate Setup**: The alternate batch script ensures functionality and successfully starts all components, demonstrating the full application behavior.
